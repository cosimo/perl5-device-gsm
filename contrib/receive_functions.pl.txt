Hi Cosimo,

Thanks for your very usefull module, I've used it to build SMS 2 E-mail
bidirectional gateway, and today I'm going to test it within my company,
just to see how it behaves in high volume environment.
I did add a couple of subroutines to your module (receive and delmessage) to
be able to get SMS messages out of my Nokia 6210, and it works lika a charm.
Please find them at the end of this e-mail if you want to include them in
new version of Device::GSM.

Anyway, I have a couple of questions that you may be able to answer, as I
believe you have much more experience here:

1. If I send e-mail with "@" character in message body to GSM user, when SMS
is received, "@" is converted somehow into "i". Example:
        "Hi X, here is the e-mail address : someone@com.com" would become
"Hi X, here is the e-mail address : someoneicom.com" when received on
mobile.
 Any idea why this is happening? If I send SMS with the same message to
mailbox, message arrives as it is, correctly. I'm using the same mechanism
to parse message, so I'm kinda confused.

2. When sending multiple lines of text from e-mail to sms, like this:

Hi,
here
I am

It will arrive fine to GSM device, but if this message is replied to with
"include original message" turned on, the newline characters will become
visible.

Any ideas welcome.

Thanks,
Haris
