NAME
    Device::Gsm - Perl extension to interface GSM cellular / modems

WARNING
       This is C<PRE-ALPHA> software, still needs extensive testing and
       support for custom GSM commands, so use it at your own risk,
       and without C<ANY> warranty! Have fun.

SYNOPSIS
      use Device::Gsm;

      # NOT YET DEFINED!
      my $gsm = new Device::Gsm( port => '/dev/ttyS1', PIN => '0124' );

      if( $gsm->connect() ) {
          print "connected!\n";
      } else {
          print "sorry, no connection with gsm phone on serial port!\n';
      }

      # Register to GSM network (you must supply PIN number in above new() call)
      $gsm->register();
 
      # Set service center number (depends on your network operator)
      $gsm->service_number( '+001505050' );   # This one is fake, not usable!
 
      # Retrieve actual stored service number
      print 'Service number is now: ', $gsm->service_number(), "\n";
 
      # Send a short text message (SMS)
      $modem->send_sms( '0123456789', 'A little message from Device::Gsm' );
 
DESCRIPTION
    Device::Gsm class implements basic GSM network registration and SMS
    sending functions. For now, it is only an example that inherits from
    Device::Modem for all low-level functions. It is planned to add more
    custom GSM commands support, with device identification, and so on...
