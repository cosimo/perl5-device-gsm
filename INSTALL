This is a perl module extension. If you don't know
what it means, please take the time to go to
http://www.cpan.org/ or http://www.perl.org


,-------------------------.
|     PRE-REQUISITES      |
`-------------------------'

- a working perl installation (version 5.005+ recommended, although this
  module has been reported to work also for 5.004)

- Device::Modem perl extension (possibly version >= 1.24)
  Download this extension from [http://cpan.perl.org/modules/by-module/Device/]

- a GSM cellular phone or GSM modem. Various models have been
  reported to work. Some of these are:

	Nokia 6600           (19200)
	Nokia 6310           (19200)
	Nokia 3310           (19200)
	Siemens C45          (19200)
	Siemens S35          (19200)
	Nokia Communicator    (9600)
	Falcom A2/Swing       (9600)
	Digicom GSM modems    (9600)
	...

  If your GSM phone/modem is not reported in this little list, don't
  despair. Most probably it will work without problems.

  PLEASE NOTE:
  without a GSM phone/cellular connected to a serial port at your
  choice, you will not be able to use this module in ANY useful way.
