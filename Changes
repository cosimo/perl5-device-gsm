Revision history for Perl extension Device::Gsm.

1.61  Tue Jun 21 21:05:12 CEST 2016
    - Fixed RT#115491, remove the use of the encodings pragma, now deprecated.
    - Plenty of style, test and functionality fixes contributed by Joel Maslak
      and Paul Cochrane, as part of the CPAN PR Challenge. Awesome job, thanks!
    - Amended the main module documentation to make it clear this module is
      in maintenance mode and hasn't seen any major development work in years.

1.60  Fri Mar 16 12:14:07 CET 2012
    - Removed the syslog test. Was artificial and pointless,
      and it failed on Windows and Solaris. Thanks to CPAN testers reports.

    - Fixed RT #75619, POD fixes to make the POD clean for Debian packaging.

      but getting no answer from the phone.

1.57  Mon Mar  7 20:53:03 EST 2011

      test case.

      between the +CMSG command and the actual text.

    - Added clear example of logging to a custom file
    - Added a warning for not implemented _read_messages_text()

1.50  Tue Sep 30 22:50:00 CEST 2008
    - Sometimes send_sms() could report success but no sms
